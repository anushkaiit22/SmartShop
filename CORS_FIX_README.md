# CORS Fix for SmartShop Backend

## Problem
The frontend application was experiencing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors when trying to make requests to the backend API. The error message was:

```
Access to fetch at 'https://smartshop-backend-3xenf4eub-anushka-pimpales-projects.vercel.app/api/v1/robot/interact' from origin 'https://smart-shop-frontend-git-master-anushka-pimpales-projects.vercel.app' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

## Solution
I've implemented a comprehensive CORS fix that includes:

### 1. Custom CORS Middleware
- Added a custom CORS middleware in `main.py` that dynamically handles Vercel domains
- Supports both local development and production Vercel deployments
- Automatically allows any domain ending with `.vercel.app`

### 2. Enhanced Robot Endpoint
- Added explicit OPTIONS handler for CORS preflight requests
- Modified all response handlers to include proper CORS headers
- Created a helper function `create_cors_response()` for consistent CORS handling

### 3. Updated Configuration
- Updated `app/core/config.py` to include specific Vercel domains
- Added support for dynamic Vercel preview deployments

## Files Modified

### `main.py`
- Added custom CORS middleware class `CustomCORSMiddleware`
- Added global OPTIONS handler for all routes
- Enhanced CORS configuration for Vercel deployment

### `app/core/config.py`
- Updated `CORS_ORIGINS` to include specific Vercel domains
- Added support for Vercel preview deployments

### `app/api/v1/endpoints/robot.py`
- Added explicit OPTIONS handler with proper CORS headers
- Created `create_cors_response()` helper function
- Updated all response handlers to use CORS-enabled responses
- Added proper error handling with CORS headers

## Deployment

### Option 1: Using the Deployment Script
```bash
python deploy_cors_fix.py
```

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if not already installed
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

## Testing

### Test CORS Configuration
```bash
python test_cors.py
```

This script will:
1. Test CORS preflight requests
2. Test the robot endpoint with proper headers
3. Verify that CORS headers are present in responses

### Manual Testing
You can also test manually by:

1. Opening your frontend application
2. Opening browser developer tools (F12)
3. Going to the Network tab
4. Making a request to the robot endpoint
5. Checking that the request succeeds without CORS errors

## Expected Results

After deployment, you should see:
- ✅ No CORS errors in browser console
- ✅ Successful API requests from frontend to backend
- ✅ Proper CORS headers in API responses
- ✅ Robot chat functionality working correctly

## Troubleshooting

### If CORS errors persist:
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for Vercel deployment to propagate
2. Clear browser cache and reload
3. Check that the deployment URL is correct
4. Verify that the frontend is using the correct backend URL

### If deployment fails:
1. Check that Vercel CLI is installed: `vercel --version`
2. Ensure you're logged in: `vercel login`
3. Check your Vercel project configuration

## Additional Notes

- The CORS fix is backward compatible with local development
- All existing functionality remains unchanged
- The fix handles both production and preview deployments
- Error handling has been improved to return proper CORS headers even on errors

## Support

If you continue to experience issues after implementing this fix:
1. Check the browser's Network tab for specific error details
2. Verify the deployment was successful
3. Test with the provided test script
4. Check Vercel deployment logs for any backend errors
